# Unit Test : Test Driven Development

```All what you need about Test Driven Development```

There is a standard way to structure a test. This is the AAA method, or Arrange - Act - Assert: 

  * **Arrange :** initialize all necessary inputs and the system to be tested if necessary. 
  * **Act :** Run the system under test with previously initialized inputs into outputs that you keep. 
  * **Assert :** Validate outbounds based on what is expected from your inbounds. You then conclude whether it is a success or a failure.

The figure below illustrates the entire overall architecture of the test :
